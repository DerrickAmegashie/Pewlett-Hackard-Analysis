Due to this, Pewlett Hackard’s is thinking of what retirement packages to offer and which positions to fill in the near future. I was tasked to help Bobby find out who will be retiring in the following years and how many positions will the company need to fill. The analysis will be helpful by allowing Pewlett Hackard know who is eligible for the retirement package.  I used SQL to develop an employee database by applying my data modelling, engineering and analytics skills.
